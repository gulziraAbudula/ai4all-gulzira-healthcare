# Heathcare Facility Resilliance to Power Outages in United States

In the AI4ALL Ignite program, we worked on an AI project designed to address the critical challenge of natural disasters disrupting both energy supply and health services. It proposes developing an emergency power allocation model, especially drawing from renewable energy sources, for mobile health units and backup systems in the U.S. The purpose of the project was to apply machine learning techniques to address a real-world problem while promoting responsible and ethical use of AI.


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Can we accurately predict which U.S. health entities are most vulnerable during a hazardous natural disaster and the amount of renewable emergency power allocated for mobile backup units?

*EXAMPLE:*
*Given the substantial daily output of responses, the identification and mitigation of ChatGPT's biases become critical, safeguarding both the multitude of users and the far-reaching consequences they may influence.*

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

This system
1. Enabled proactive energy support planning for healthcare systems during emergencies
2. Ensured equitable and efficient response through AI integration
3. Integrated diverse data sources, including:
      - Meteorological APIs
      - Federal risk indexes
      - Healthcare infrastructure datasets   
4. Bridged a vital gap between AI, healthcare, and environmental preparedness


*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
